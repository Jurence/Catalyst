# Ziico-Ransomware
Beginner Ransomware program for Simple Security Testing   

# About Ziico 
Ziico encrypts all of your documents, photos, videos, music, specific database and other important files hence rendering innaccesibility to the encrypted category.  Therefore, to reaccess these encrypted files, a decryption key is required. Files that could be encrypted can vary and in most cases there is no turning back once executed. This ransomware is for study purpose and is meant to encrypt a few of your files to test whether your system security is just fine.      Ziico Ransomware is built using C# thus easily embedded. There is a preety more advance version of this program which is Fully Undetectable and because of this, i cannot upload it for certain reasons. This particular program follows an AES-256,AES-128 and a SHA256 Encryption. I believe thats preety strong and has proven to bypass four anti virus programs.
